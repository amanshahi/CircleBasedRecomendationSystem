Jan_20_'00	Ready 2 Rumble is a great game. You get to fight and train cartoon like characters. You have to gain the Championship Title to actually beat the game. It has great graphics. There are enough moves for each character to keep you playing all day.	/game-review-1DD1-CF20B8-388768BA-bd1	Ready 2 Rumble Boxing	/game-Software-All-Dreamcast-Ready_2_Rumble_Boxing	Video Games	/game-Software-All	5.0	2
